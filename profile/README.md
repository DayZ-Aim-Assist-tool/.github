## 🔬 Advanced Tuning

| Parameter    | Description                 | Range   | Default |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | ------- | ------- |
| `smooth`     | Aim transition rate         | 0.1–1.0 | 0.45    |
| `fov`        | Target lock range (degrees) | 30–180  | 110     |
| `prediction` | Movement curve              | 0–1     | 0.7     |
| `stability`  | Recoil suppression factor   | 0–100   | 60      |
| `delay`      | Input response latency (ms) | 0–50    | 15      |

> [!TIP]
> For realism, increase `smooth` and reduce `fov` for scoped weapons like Mosin-Nagant or SVD rifles.
